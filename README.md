# CLOTHES RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

### GOAL

I will try to build a system that recommends clothes that are similar to particular clothes. I will compute pairwise similarity scores for all clothes based on their descriptions and recommend clothes based on that similarity score.

I am going to use Content-Based filtering. This type of recommendation system mapping each item into a feature space and recommendations depend on item characteristics. Items are represented by vectors in this space.

### DATASET

The data set has 500 rows and 2 columns:

- "id": Item id

- "description" : The clothes description
